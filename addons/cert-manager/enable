===========================

Cert-manager is installed. As a next step, try creating a ClusterIssuer
for Let's Encrypt by creating the following resource:

$ microk8s kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt
spec:
  acme:
    # You must replace this email address with your own.
    # Let's Encrypt will use this to contact you about expiring
    # certificates, and issues related to your account.
    email: me@example.com
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      # Secret resource that will be used to store the account's private key.
      name: letsencrypt-account-key
    # Add a single challenge solver, HTTP01 using nginx
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: public
EOF

Then, you can create an ingress to expose 'my-service:80' on 'https://my-service.example.com' with:

$ microk8s enable ingress
$ microk8s kubectl create ingress my-ingress \
    --annotation cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer=letsencrypt \
    --rule 'my-service.example.com/*=my-service:80,tls=my-service-tls'
"
